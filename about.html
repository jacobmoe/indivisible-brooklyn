    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p><strong>Indivisible Brooklyn</strong> is a community of citizens in Brooklyn, New York, organizing to take sustainable, consistent, collective political action aimed at the federal, New York State, and New York City governments, to<p>

    <ol>
      <li>stand in the way of the Trump/Republican agenda, and</li>
      <li>promote progressive policy, civic engagement, strength in community, and coordinated action.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We're part of the nationwide grassroots movement inspired by the <a href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/" target="_blank">Indivisible Guide</a>. We welcome Brooklynites of all races, classes, sexual orientations, gender identities, ethnicities, ages, religions, and physical abilities. We aim to provide each other with support and accountability in a community that shares values, goals, and the desire to defend against the regressive policies of this administration.</p>

    <p>We're currently organizing in three teams. Each team works with its members to define pressing issues, set goals, and organize actions, sharing information with the rest of the group. Every member of Indivisible Brooklyn is always encouraged to join actions coordinated by other teams.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>The Federal team</strong> uses the Indivisible model to pressure, support, and hold accountable our elected officials in the U.S. Congress: Sen. Chuck Schumer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and our various representatives in the House.</li>
      <li><strong>The State team</strong> uses the Indivisible model to pressure, support, and hold accountable Gov. Andrew Cuomo and our elected officials in the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly.</li>
      <li><strong>The City team</strong> uses the Indivisible model to pressure, support, and hold accountable Mayor Bill de Blasio and our elected officials on the New York City Council. It's also responsible for building partnerships with other local organizations, groups, and activists engaged in similar work.</li>
    </ol>
